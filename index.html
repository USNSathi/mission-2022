            <p class="paragraph1">Every year everyone makes some New Year's resolutions. This time my resolution was to
                become a web
                developer. And that's where I set foot. I will continue to spend time and effort until I become a good
                web
                developer. I will continue to do so until I turn it into a fulfilling and profitable career. I will
                definitely share with everyone what I will learn on this journey so that others can learn from my
                successes
                and failures. I hope my mission 2022 will not be in vain.</p>

            <p class="paragraph1">Development has no limit. Development is defined as the process of growth or new
                information or an event. It could also
                be used to describe a new and advanced idea or product. Web development can range from developing a
                simple single static
                page of plain text to complex web applications. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web
                development commonly
                refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, Web server and network
                security configuration,
                and e-commerce development.</p>

                are without a doubt the best
                places to find an answer to pretty much any coding question. They reward users who answer questions
                often and do so
                thoughtfully. These global also helps ensure this by suspending users who demonstrate any unhelpful
                behaviour. You can
                rest assured that you are receiving top notch advice anytime you are looking for help. The only drawback
                to this
                programming community is that there is so much going on, it can be daunting for the novice coder. Take
                your time, spend
                a little while lurking and reading and then jump in when youâ€™re ready. All these global community is a
                friendly bunch.</p>
